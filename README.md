## Challenges
- Imaages refusing to display
- recycler view was only displyaing a single contact which was caused by using match parent on the cardviews horizontal margin
- Had a few bugs working with navigation component. I couldn't get the args bundle to store a parcelable object.

## More Features

I would like to authentication, internationalization, dowmload functionality and ability to save other kinds of documents for easy access and retrival.
